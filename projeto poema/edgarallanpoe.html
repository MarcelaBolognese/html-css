           <p>
                Once Upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary, <br>
                Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore- <br>
                While I modded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping, <br>
                As of some one gently rapping,  rapping at my chamber door. <br>
                "Tis some visiter," I muttered, "tapping at my chamber door- <br>
                Only this and nothing more." <br>
            </p>
                
            <p>
                Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December, <br>
                And each separete dyng ember wrought its ghost upon the floor, <br>
                Eagerly I wished the morrow;-Vainly I had sought to borrow <br>
                From my books surcease of sorrow-sorrow for the lost Leonore- <br>
                For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Leonore- <br>
                Nameless here for evermore. <br>
            </p>

            <p>
                And the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain <br>
                Thrilled me- filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before; <br>
                So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating <br>
                "Tis some visiter entraating entrance at my chamber door- <br>
                Some late visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door- <br>
                This it is and nothing more." <br>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer, <br>
                "Sir," said I, "or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore; <br>
                But the fact is I was napping, andso gently you came rapping, <br>
                And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door, <br>
                That I scarce was sure I heard you"-here I opened wide the door;- <br>
                Darkness there and nothing more. <br>
            </p>

            <p>
                Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing, <br>
                Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortals ever dared to dream before; <br>
                But the silence was unbroken, and the darkness gave no token, <br>
                And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, "Lenore!" <br>
                This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, "Lenore!" <br>
                Merely this, and nothing more. <br>
            </p>
        </section> 
        
        <section class="imagem">
            <p>
                Back into the chaber turning, all my soul within me burning, <br>
                Soon I heard again a tapping somewhat louder than before. <br>
                "Surely," said I, "surely that is something at my window lattice; <br>
                Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore- <br>
                Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;- <br>
                'Tis the wind and nothing more!" <br>
            </p>

         <section class="normal">    
            <p>
                Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter, <br>
                In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore; <br>
                Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he; <br>
                But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door- <br>
                Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door- <br>
                Perched, and sat, and nothing more. <br>
            </p>
                
            <p>
                Then the ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy  into smiling, <br>
                By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore, <br>
                "Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou," I said, "art sure no craven, <br>
                Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore- <br>
                Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!" <br>
                Quoth the Raven "Nevermore." <br>
            </p>

            <p>
                Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly, <br>
                Though its answer little meaning-little relevancy bore; <br>
                For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being <br>
                Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door- <br>
                Birdor beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door, <br>
                With such name as "Nevermore." <br>
            </p>
                
            <p>
                But the Raven, sotting lonely on that placid bust, spoke only <br>
                That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour. <br>
                Nothing farther then he uttered-not a feather then he fluttered- <br>
                Till I scarcely more than muttered: "Other friends have flown before." <br>
                On the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before." <br>
                Then the bird said "Nevermore" <br>
            </p>
                
            <p>
                Startled at the stillness broken by replay so aptly spoken, <br>
                "Doubless," said I, "what it utters is its only stock and store, <br>
                Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster <br>
                Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore- <br>
                Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore - <br>
                Of 'Never-nevermore.'" <br>
            </p>

            <p>
                But the raven still beguiling my sad fancy into smiling, <br>
                Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door; <br>
                Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking- <br>
                Fancy unton fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore- <br>
                What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore <br>
                Meant in croaking "Nevermore." <br>
            </p>
        </section> 
        
        <section class="normal">
            <p>
                This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing <br>
                To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core; <br>
                This and more Isat divining, with my head at ease reclining <br>
                On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o'er, <br>
                But whose velvet violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o'er <br>
                She shall press, ah, nevermore! <br>
            </p>
                
            <p>
                Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer <br>
                Swung by seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor. <br>
                "Wretch," I cried, "thy God hath lent thee-by these angels he hath sent thee <br>
                Respite-respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore; <br>
                Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!" <br>
                Quoth the Raven "Nevermore." <br>
            </p>
                
            <p>
                "Prophet!" said I, "thing of evil!-prophet still, if bird or devil! <br>
                By that Heaven that bends above us-by  that God we both adore- <br>
                Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn, <br>
                It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore- <br>
                Clasp rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore." <br>
                Quoth the Raven "Nevermore." <br>
            </p>
                
            <p>
                "Be that our sign of parting, bird or fiend!" Ishrieked, upstarting- <br>
                "Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore! <br>
                Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken! <br>
                Leave my loneliness unbroken!-quit the bust above my door! <br>
                Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door! <br>
                Take thy beak from out my heart, and  take  thy form off my door!" <br>
                Quoth the Raven "Nevermore." <br>

                And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting <br>
                On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door; <br>
                And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming, <br>
                And the lamp-light o'er him streaming throws his shadows on the floor; <br>
                And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor <br>
                Shall be lifted-nevermore! <br>
