            Once Upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary, <br>
            Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore- <br>
            While I modded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping, <br>
            As of some one gently rapping,  rapping at my chamber door. <br>
            "Tis some visiter," I muttered, "tapping at my chamber door- <br>
            Only this and nothing more." <br>

            <br>

            Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December, <br>
            And each separete dyng ember wrought its ghost upon the floor, <br>
            Eagerly I wished the morrow;-Vainly I had sought to borrow <br>
            From my books surcease of sorrow-sorrow for the lost Leonore- <br>
            For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Leonore- <br>
            Nameless here for evermore. <br>

            <br>

            And the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain <br>
            Thrilled me- filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before; <br>
            So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating <br>
            "Tis some visiter entraating entrance at my chamber door- <br>
            Some late visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door- <br>
    
            
        </p>
